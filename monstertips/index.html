							<h1>General Tips</h1>
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							It is generally best to follow these rules at all times:
							<ul>
								<li>Keep your health at 100% at all times, don&rsquo;t put it off!</li>
								<li>Pickup pad shields frequently. A lot of maps sport 2 of these, so learn their
									locations, and visit often.
								</li>
								<li>On most maps, pad shields re-spawn every 30 seconds after pickup.</li>
								<li>Try to use weapons that will help your current scenario.</li>
								<li>That random VOOMPH sound you hear means one of the power-ups on the map has spawned,
									SEEK IT OUT!
								</li>
								<li>It is not illegal to use the Imperius, SO USE IT!</li>
								<li>Try to &quot;predict&quot; your enemy movements and take them down based on where
									they are heading.
								</li>
								<li>Try to randomise your movements if you can. If you walk/run in straight lines
									everywhere then others will predict you, and you will die because of it.
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h3>Please note</h3>
							These tips may or may not be accurate to some people but they are a personal insight into
							how i think and what i know and how to use things to become victoriuos. People may argue the
							validity of my tips but they will definetly help out the less skilled so it&rsquo;s mission
							is complete. Argueing with any points is a waste of time, remember these are personal tips.

							<h2>Free For All (Deathmatch)</h2>
							Everyone is your enemy; so take them out to wrack up your point count! Here are some
							essential tips for this game type:
							<ul>
								<li>Killer ducks rule in this game type, so use them! They make hitting the frag limit
									much easier.
								</li>
								<li>Collect the pad power often and it will help you gain a huge advantage so maybe you
									want to hang around near the spawn point of this power-up ;]
								</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Spray Your Colour FFA (SYC)</h2>
							Knock out an enemy and pick up the green cartridge left behind; find the portal, and spray
							on either wall to score points! Sometimes this can be very tricky when everyone is out to
							get you, so here are some essential tips:
							<ul>
								<li>before you go into combat for cartridges, shield up if you can. This makes heading
									to the spray room portal much less stressful, and you will make it to the spray room
									without dieing so much.
								</li>
								<li>Maps without a pad shield or 2 are generally going to be tougher, so take extra
									care.
								</li>
								<li>If you have just 1 or 2 carts, go for the portal... as the larger your collection
									the more likely it is that you will be ganged up on. You are more likely to win with
									lots of 1-2 carts than a much harder to acquire collection of 5-8.
								</li>
								<li>Sometimes, when there is a heated war going on for someone’s 8 cartridges, people
									tend to forget about the power-ups that spawn in, this is a perfect chance for you
									to break away and turn into the powerhouse you dream of, and then go on a cartridge
									collecting spree!
								</li>
								<li>Floater is more valued in this game type, because you can use it to collect carts
									and quickly escape, but be wary of snipers.
								</li>
								<li>Frequently search the less popular parts of the map for carts that will be lying
									around, you will be surprised at how many you might find.
								</li>
								<li>So, you have 7 cartridges and you want to get a spray-god, but you ran into the
									portal because someone was chasing you? No problem, just run back out and find
									another cart if you can but try to stay away from the action and then sneak back
									into the portal, this is a very dangerous tactic, but can pay off!
								</li>
								<li>If there is a huge battle going on, why not stay back and wait until they weaken
									each other, then jump in and finish them off for some big green cartridge rewards
									XD.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>


						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Spray Your Colour Team Play (SYC TP)</h2>
							Knock out a member of the opposing team and pick up your team colour cartridge;find the
							portal and <u>spray on your team’s coloured wall</u> to score! but that is very robotic, so
							here are some team play tips:
							<ul>
								<li>Stay near your team members.</li>
								<li>Dominate vital pad shield points and power-up spawns as a team. The enemy will be so
									much easier to mow down.
								</li>
								<li>If more than 2 members of your team have cartridges, then why not all meet in the
									spray room and throw them to one person, spray killers / spray gods will get you
									many more points!
								</li>
								<li>unless you want your team to scream at you, don’t spray on the wrong wall too often
									;]
								</li>
								<li>If a member of your team has the imperius then protect that person!</li>
								<li>If you see members of your team die they will drop a cartridge in the colour of the
									other team, run over it to delete it before the other team gets a chance to pick it
									up!
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>BigBalloon (BB)</h2>
							As a team, capture and hold 3 balloons placed in strategic locations. Sounds easy yes?
							WRONG! but these tips may help you hold them for longer...
							<ul>
								<li>before you go capturing, why not pickup some nice weapons first?</li>
								<li>Camp at balloons if necessary to hold them.</li>
								<li>If it’s possible, hide high and above a balloon or in a location you are hard to
									spot with a view of the balloon so you can take out enemy capturers.
								</li>
								<li>The enemy has all balloons under their control? Then spend an extra few seconds
									picking up the often ignored power-ups.
								</li>
								<li>A team member heading for a balloon you are heading to? Maybe turn around and head
									for another balloon, the more balloons you take back at once, then the more the
									enemy has to split up.
								</li>
								<li>If your team has all the balloons under their control then don’t let the enemy find
									undefended balloons, defend them all!
								</li>
								<li>The more your team co-ordinates, the higher the chance of winning. Maybe have some
									attackers, defenders, and free roamers?
								</li>
							</ul>

							<h2>Last Pad Standing (LPS)</h2>
							Do what you must to overcome all your enemies and be the last pad standing to win. Some
							handy hints:
							<ul>
								<li>Try not to get into fights early on. Take your time and stand back.</li>
								<li>Collect as much weapons/ammo and power-ups as you can while avoiding fights early in
									the game.
								</li>
								<li>Pounce on the weak.</li>
								<li>Run away from the strong.</li>
								<li>Play tactically. Do whatever you must to win, whether it be fighting or running.
								</li>

							<h1>Weapon Handling</h1>
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							Do you favor a certain weapon but does it
							gets you killed all too much? Maybe you&rsquo;re using the wrong weapons for the wrong
							scenarios? Well whatever the reason it doesn&rsquo;t matter because these could help you!
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Punchy</h2>
							Like our site developer Smiley you prefer to use the duck-like Punchy often but maybe you
							want some tips? Here you go:
							<ul>
								<li>An enemy just went into a health station near you but is looking the wrong way? Get
									the punchy out and charge in for the kill, it&rsquo;ll scare them ;]
								</li>
								<li>You just climbed something and at the top you find a sniper on the edge of something
									not looking your way at all? Then get your punchy out and WALK to your opponent, he
									will not hear you; and you can go for the kill when you are close enough.
								</li>
								<li>The power-up &ldquo;speedy&rdquo; will help you get even more speed than is normally
									possible. use it to confuse and take down opponents, but be warned, if you&rsquo;re
									not experienced enough with the speedy you could get very frustrated.
								</li>
								<li>If your opponents are always up close to you, but they are not very strong? Then get
									the punchy out and bite them down!
								</li>
								<li>It is generally not good to use a punchy against an opponent with a betty, balloony
									or boaster, as they may make quick work of you.
								</li>
								<li>This weapon combined with the Pad power can see you take a lot of pads down to
									become &ldquo;puppet master&rdquo;
									if used correctly.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Nipper</h2>This default starting range weapon may not be the best choice, but it has a
							few uses (to some people anyway):
							<ul>
								<li>The nipper is better at taking people down that have stars above their head.</li>
								<li>Some people can wrack up a lot of points by using this weapon, learn to master it
									and you can annoy the hell out of your opponents, because no-one likes to be nipped
									to death ;]
								</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Pumper</h2>
							This powerful medium range weapon is often not used unless it&rsquo;s the only choice left,
							but this weapon is truly devastating if used properly:
							<ul>
								<li>If you have a good aim, then 2-3 direct hits on an unshielded opponent will see them
									come crashing down hard and fast!
								</li>
								<li>If your opponent is dodging your shots then no worries... aim at their feet and tell
									them to start dancing, as the splash damage will see them kiss your feet quickly ;]
								</li>
								<li>It is possible to get a feel for when your opponent is just out of range, use it
									often and you will learn that a decently used pumper + bubble G combo will be that&rsquo;s
									all you need for close &ndash; medium
									&ndash; long range.
								</li>
								<li>This weapon has more power than people give it credit for! DO not underestimate
									it.
								</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Balloony</h2>
							&lsquo;LOONS A&rsquo;Hoy! This weapon be truly devastating if used well and can also stop
							crowds dead in their tracks, but be warned, taking yourself out in the process will see your
							rampage come to a dead-end.
							<ul>
								<li>You can cover an area with explosions effectively by firing &lsquo;loons in random
									directions towards an area.
								</li>
								<li>If you&rsquo;re about to go through a teleporter, then just before you teleport,
									fire a loon just above / to the side of you slightly so it bounces past you, but
									will hit someone chasing you.
								</li>
								<li>use this weapon in places with a lot of players, it will cause a riot, just be
									EXTREMELY careful and stay back if you can.
								</li>
								<li>Combine this weapon with the Pad power to become a true force to be fearful of.</li>
								<li>If your opponent is totally unshielded then 1 direct hit loon will be enough to
									knock them out!
								</li>
								<li>If you see someone approach a jump pad you just used, then stand back, and as he
									appears, fire some loons in the jump pads path, but try to predict it so both the
									enemy and the loon will connect. This takes some practice, but is ever so useful for
									easy knockouts.
								</li>
								<li>Do not use &lsquo;loons when you are low on health... I would rather use the nipper
									than this on low health (medium range anyway).
								</li>
								<li>Extremely good against someone that is standing still.</li>
								<li>Good at firing at health stations in use.</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Betty</h2>
							Be warned: this &ldquo;girl&rdquo; is hotter than any on 2 legs, so here is a bit of info on
							how to tame such heat and use it to your advantage:
							<ul>
								<li>This weapon has huge splash damage, so why not aim near an opponents feet if he is
									mid-range to take them off their feet!
								</li>
								<li>Direct hits are truly damaging.</li>
								<li>Not so good for long range, but can be used if practiced enough.</li>
								<li>be careful not to fry yourself on close opponents or objects.</li>
								<li>Good at firing at health stations in use.</li>
								<li>With a jumper you can rain fireballs on your opponent!</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Boaster</h2>
							Some people say this weapon is weak and hard to use but for some this weapon is good at
							draining the health of your opponent quickly, here&rsquo;s how to:
							<ul>
								<li>Instead of firing in a straight line at your enemy, zigzag it, and you will do more
									damage this way.
								</li>
								<li>If you look down on a jump pad from its landing location then you can cover the
									flight path with the stream, and whoever comes up will drop just as they hit the
									top.
								</li>
								<li>Excellent at doing a lot of damage to a pad powered opponent.</li>
								<li>Excellent at stopping pesky Punchy users in their tracks.</li>
								<li>More or less the only weapon to deal damage to &ldquo;puppet masters&rdquo;.</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">
							<!-- text begin -->
							<h2>Splasher</h2>
							Love it or Hate it. This is a must have for all snipers.
							<ul>
								<li>Don&rsquo;t use this weapon in normal combat too much; the long reload will give
									your opponents a lot of time to take you down.
								</li>
								<li>Against an unshielded opponent it will knock them out in 1-2 shots.</li>
								<li>Against a 100% shielded opponent it will take most of the shield away and some
									health away.
								</li>
								<li>Against a 200% shielded opponent you might as well be very good at aiming to get
									multiple shots in or jump down with something more suitable.
								</li>
								<li>Good against weakening and eventually knocking out the player with the pad power.
								</li>
								<li>Master this weapon to it&rsquo;s true potential and people will fear you.</li>
							</ul>
							<!-- text end -->
						</div>

						<div class="content-box news-text">

							<h2>Imperius</h2>
							This is the weapon people dream of using in this game, but it can be hard to get. If you are
							lucky enough to use one, try to use it without blasting yourself to Pluto with these
							essential IMP-tips:
							<ul>
								<li>Remember this weapon once picked up will only spawn again in 2 minutes time, so it&rsquo;s
									no good sitting there waiting for it to spawn if someone has just taken it, you will
									fall so far behind in the game.
								</li>
								<li>Remember this weapon is NOT available in big-balloon games for the reason of
									balance.
								</li>
								<li>When you use this weapon, make sure you fire it at long distance.</li>
								<li>If you are fully shielded you can use it against medium distanced opponents and
									still survive.
								</li>
								<li>Don&rsquo;t hold the charge too long... or you will lose your hands.</li>
								<li>When this weapon is combined with the pad power you can turn into a suicide bomb and
									still survive to collect the green cartridge goodness.
								</li>
								<li>The ammo for this gun is harder to find in the maps, but if your IMP is out of ammo,
									it&rsquo;s worth while getting more.
								</li>
								<li>The Imperius is not lame to use, its charge time and 2 minute respawn means that who
									ever gets it, then it&rsquo;s well done to them and ha-ha to you. Don&rsquo;t like
									it? Get it yourself, or learn to counter it, it&rsquo;s possible, so stop yer whinin&rsquo;!
